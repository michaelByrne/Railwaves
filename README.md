# Railwaves Acoustic Classification System
The current state of a longterm research project seeking to solve the problem of acoustic classification in noisy and unpredictable environments. While easily generalized to any number of "acoustic events," here I classiy different types of train cars, with the goal being an accurate accounting of oil and coal car traffic. The most recent completed stage is described in the notebook titled Spring_2017_Paper. Everything else in the repository is either data, audio processing utilities, or classes implementing NNs and tests for NNs. As I advance the project to the next stage, actually implementing the thing on embedded hardware, a key checkbox is refactoring the existing codebase with an eye toward reproducability and modularity.
